### What are the three main purposes of an operating system?
The three main purpose of an OS are:
* To provide an environment for users to execute their programs on computer hardware in a convenient efficient manner.
* Process management, the resource allocation between applications should be as fair and efficient as possible.
* Supervision of running processes, and management of I/O devices.

### We have stressed the need for an operating system to make efficient use of the computing hardware. When is it appropriate for the operating system to forsake this principle and to “waste” resources? Why is such a system not really wasteful?
* Single graphic user system should provide a good user experience for the user. HA (high availability) system with a second server in stand-by mode can also count.
