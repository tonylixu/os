### In a multiprogramming and time-sharing environment, several users share the system simultaneously. This situation can result in various security problems.
* What are two such problems?
* Can we ensure the same degree of security in a time-shared machine as in a dedicated machine? Explain your answer.

Answer:
* Access to user data from different users.
* Access to system resources from different users.

Mechanisms have to be inplace to ensure that system resources such as files, memories CPUs can be operated on by only proper authorizaed processes. For example, memory-addressing hardware ensures that a process can execute only within its own address space.
